            <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to create document on the <u><i>World Wide Web</i></u>. 
                It is simply a collection of certain key words called "Tags" that are helpful in writing the document to be displayed 
                using a browser on Internet. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1992.</p>
